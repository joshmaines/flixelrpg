Compilation requirements
=========
Flixel library is included because it has been modified greatly.  All you have to do is load the project file into FlashDevelop and target the latest version of Air.  Do not target Flash!  This game engine is designed using external data files and is intended for desktop use rather than web-based gaming.  However, if you remove a few of the features, the game engine should work for Flash Player 11+.

Current status of engine
=========
Initial version.  Very barebones and incomplete.  Just getting started. Check the demo folder for a demonstration of what's possible with this engine.

Version 0.0.2
